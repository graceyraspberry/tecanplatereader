### tecanplatereader
This is the script for data processing/analyses of the Tecan experiments that I have been running with different mutations, conditions, and on different dates with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Experiment descriptions file includes the information on the experiment dates and Tecan machine used. Not all of the experiments had good data, and I only used the ones that came out well (noted in the script as well).
